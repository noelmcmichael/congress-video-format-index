### Hearings Discovered
- **278 Total Hearings Found** (79 House + 199 Senate)
- **17 Hearings Stored** in database (with proper committee associations)
- **Sample hearings** from multiple committees with metadata

### Video Formats Identified
- **8 Video Platform Instances** detected in raw data
- **JWPlayer**: Most common platform (JavaScript-based)
- **YouTube**: Some committees use embedded players
- **Custom Players**: Many committees use proprietary solutions

## üîç Key Technical Findings

### House of Representatives Architecture
- **Decentralized Structure**: Each committee has independent website
- **URL Pattern**: `[committee-name].house.gov`
- **Consistent Branding**: All use house.gov domain structure
- **Individual Management**: Each committee manages own content

### Senate Architecture
- **Mixed Structure**: Centralized directory + independent sites
- **URL Patterns**: Both `senate.gov` and external domains
- **Standardized Listing**: Central committee table with metadata
- **Better Accessibility**: More structured data access

### Video Streaming Challenges
1. **JavaScript Dependencies**: Most players require JS execution
2. **Custom Implementations**: Many committees use proprietary players
3. **Access Controls**: Some sites restrict automated access
4. **Rate Limiting**: Aggressive protection on some committee sites
5. **Inconsistent Standards**: No unified video platform across Congress
