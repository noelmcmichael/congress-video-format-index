## Technical Findings

### Website Architecture

**House of Representatives:**
- Uses decentralized committee websites
- Each committee has its own subdomain (e.g., agriculture.house.gov)
- Total unique domains: 21

**Senate:**
- Uses centralized committee directory
- Mixed approach with both senate.gov and external domains
- Total unique domains: 23

### Scraping Challenges Identified

1. **Inconsistent Website Structures**: Each committee uses different layouts
2. **Rate Limiting**: Some sites implement aggressive rate limiting
3. **JavaScript Dependencies**: Some video players require JavaScript execution
4. **Access Restrictions**: Some committee sites block automated access
5. **Video Format Detection**: Complex embed codes and custom players

## Recommendations

### For Researchers
- Focus on Senate committees for more consistent data access
- House committees require individual analysis due to decentralized structure
- Video format detection works best on sites with standard embed codes

### For Congress
- Standardize video streaming platforms across committees
- Implement consistent accessibility features
- Provide structured data feeds for hearing information
- Consider centralized video hosting solution

## Data Quality Notes

- **Committee Discovery**: High accuracy for both chambers
- **Hearing Detection**: Variable success rate due to site differences
- **Video Format Detection**: Limited by JavaScript-heavy implementations
- **Real-time Data**: Snapshot from scraping session, not live data

## Future Work

1. **Enhanced Video Detection**: Implement Selenium for JavaScript-heavy sites
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Set up scheduled scraping for live data
3. **Accessibility Analysis**: Evaluate compliance with accessibility standards
4. **Performance Metrics**: Measure video quality and streaming reliability
5. **API Development**: Create public API for accessing the data
