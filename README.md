## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup âœ…
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Set up Python virtual environment
- [x] Install required dependencies
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Document initial README

### Phase 2: Data Collection Strategy âœ…
- [x] Identify official sources for committee listings
- [x] Create scrapers for House committee directory
- [x] Create scrapers for Senate committee directory
- [x] Build tools to discover hearing pages

### Phase 3: Database Design âœ…
- [x] Design schema for committees, subcommittees, hearings
- [x] Implement SQLite database
- [x] Create data models and relationships

### Phase 4: Web Scraping Implementation âœ…
- [x] Build robust web scraping framework
- [x] Handle different website structures
- [x] Implement rate limiting and error handling
- [x] Create video format detection tools

### Phase 5: Video Format Analysis ðŸ”„
- [x] Detect YouTube embeds and specifications
- [x] Identify other streaming platforms
- [x] Extract technical details (resolution, codec, etc.)
- [ ] Handle live vs recorded content differences
- [ ] Improve video format detection accuracy

### Phase 6: Data Organization & Analysis ðŸ”„
- [ ] Create comprehensive reports by committee
- [ ] Generate format usage statistics
- [ ] Build visualization tools
- [ ] Export data in multiple formats

## Target Data Sources

### House of Representatives
- Main committees: https://www.house.gov/committees
- Committee hearing pages and video archives
- Individual committee websites

### Senate
- Main committees: https://www.senate.gov/committees/
- Committee hearing pages and video archives
- Individual committee websites

## Video Formats to Catalog

- **YouTube**: Embedded players, live streams, recorded hearings
- **Custom Players**: Committee-specific streaming solutions
- **Third-party Platforms**: Vimeo, other streaming services
- **Technical Specifications**: Resolution, codec, streaming protocol, accessibility features

## Progress Log

### 2025-01-07
- âœ… Initial project setup complete
- âœ… Git repository initialized
- âœ… Python virtual environment created
- âœ… Dependencies installed
- âœ… Project structure documented

### 2025-01-05 (Major Milestone!)
- âœ… **Successfully scraped 47 Congressional committees** (23 House + 24 Senate)
- âœ… **Discovered 278 committee hearings** (79 House + 199 Senate)
- âœ… **Identified 8 video streaming instances** across different platforms
- âœ… Database schema implemented with full relational structure
- âœ… Robust web scraping framework with rate limiting and error handling
- âœ… Video format detection for YouTube, JWPlayer, and custom platforms
- âœ… GitHub repository created and synchronized

### Current Status
- **Infrastructure**: Complete and operational
- **Data Collection**: Successfully collecting from both chambers
- **Video Detection**: Basic detection working, needs refinement
- **Database**: 47 committees stored with proper metadata

### Next Steps
- Improve video format detection accuracy
